# Preface

Every Friday night, under the bright lights of a high school football field, 
players battle for yards, coaches strategize, referees enforce order — and 
quietly, on the sideline, a small crew makes it all possible. The chain gang.  

This book was written to shine a spotlight on that crew. Their work is often 
invisible until something goes wrong. Yet without them, the game has no 
visible line of scrimmage, no first downs, and no flow.  

Over nearly a decade of service on the chains, I’ve learned that the job is 
equal parts technical and human. It requires attention to detail, quick 
communication, and athletic awareness. It also comes with small rituals, 
inside jokes, and the shared pride of being part of “Friday Night Lights.”  

This handbook is not just about where to stand or how to hold a stick. It’s 
about building professionalism, safety, and pride in a role that deserves it. 
Whether you are an athletic director recruiting volunteers, a referee looking 
to integrate a crew, or a new parent suddenly handed a down marker, my hope is 
this book will serve as both manual and mentor.  

Above all, this book is about respect: for the game, for the officials, for 
the players, and for the volunteers who make the chains move.
