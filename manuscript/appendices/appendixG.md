# Appendix G — Away Game Notes

Most chain crews work exclusively at home games. However, experienced 
volunteers sometimes travel with their teams and encounter unusual situations 
at away venues.

## Assisting the Home Crew

- **Observation First:** Evaluate the home team’s chain crew. Are they 
understaffed or struggling with procedures?  
- **Offer Politely:** If help is clearly needed, introduce yourself to the head 
linesman and offer to assist. Do not bypass officials or insert yourself 
without approval.  
- **Stay Neutral:** Remember, you are not there to favor your school. If 
accepted, you are part of the officiating crew — not a visiting fan.

## Benefits of Helping

- Keeps the game flowing smoothly.  
- Builds goodwill between programs and officiating associations.  
- Provides valuable experience in adapting to different crew styles.

## Professional Standard

Traveling volunteers should carry the same professionalism as at home. Always 
ask permission, always defer to referees, and always maintain neutrality.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — Extra Hands on the Road

On one road trip, a visiting volunteer noticed the home crew was short a stick 
operator. With the referee’s approval, he stepped in. By halftime, the 
officials praised the adjustment, the game ran smoothly, and the schools 
avoided potential embarrassment. The lesson: experience travels well.
