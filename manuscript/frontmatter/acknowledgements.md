# Acknowledgements

No book is truly written alone — and this one certainly wasn’t.  

First, my thanks go to the countless referees, head linesmen, and officials 
I’ve had the privilege to work with. Their professionalism, patience, and 
willingness to share knowledge have shaped not only this book but also my 
understanding of the game.  

I am deeply grateful to the many volunteers who served alongside me on chain 
gangs across nearly a decade of Friday nights. From the veterans who taught me 
the finer points of positioning to the rookies who showed up in flip-flops, 
every one of you contributed to the stories, lessons, and humor found in these 
pages.  

Special thanks also go to the athletic directors who supported organized and 
professional sideline crews. Their foresight in recruiting and outfitting chain 
gangs has made a difference in the experience for players, coaches, referees, 
and fans alike.  

Finally, I want to thank my family for their encouragement and patience. They 
put up with my Friday night absences, listened to more chain gang stories than 
anyone should, and reminded me why this role — humble though it may seem — 
matters.
