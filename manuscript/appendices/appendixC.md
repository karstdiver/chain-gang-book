# Appendix C — Equipment Maintenance Guide

The chain gang’s tools are simple, but they take a beating over the course of 
a season. Proper maintenance keeps the game flowing smoothly and avoids 
sideline chaos caused by broken or unreliable gear.

## Down Box

- **Mechanical Models:** Flip through downs 1–4 before each game. Check hinges, 
  plates, and numbers for wear.  
- **LED Models:** Recharge batteries immediately post-game. Keep a manual 
  backup available in case of failure.  
- **Storage:** Avoid damp environments that corrode contacts or rot padding.

## Sticks & Chain

- **Chain:** Inspect for kinks, weak links, or bends. A chain repair kit 
  (slip rings, spring clips) should always be close at hand.  
- **Poles:** Check padding for tears and visibility. Replace faded or missing 
  covers — visibility is safety.  
- **Wrap & Store:** After games, align poles and wrap chain neatly around the 
  base. Prevents tangles and prolongs life.

## Clips

- **Durability:** Referee-issued clips are often flimsy. Homemade or custom 
  versions may last longer.  
- **Quantity:** Carry at least two. Veteran crews prefer three for redundancy.  
- **Visibility:** Ensure markings are clear and yard lines easy to identify.

## Pro Tips

- Label your gear — many schools use generic equipment, and mix-ups happen.  
- Keep a “rain kit” (plastic bags, ponchos) in the equipment box to protect 
  gear during storms.  
- Rotate equipment: if your school has multiple sets, cycle them to extend 
  lifespan.

## Professional Standard

A crew’s reputation starts with the reliability of its equipment. Smooth 
operations, fast resets, and fewer interruptions come from a crew that takes 
maintenance seriously. Referees notice — and so do athletic directors.
