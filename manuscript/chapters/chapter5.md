# Chapter 5 — Pregame Procedures

A football game begins long before the opening kickoff. For the chain gang, professionalism is established during the pregame routine. Proper preparation not only builds trust with referees but also prevents embarrassing sideline chaos once the ball is in play.

## Crew Coordination  

- **Confirm Attendance:** Contact each member of the chain crew earlier in the day. Last-minute absences are common, and substitutes may be needed.  
- **Arrival Time:** Every member should be at the stadium at least 30 minutes before kickoff. This allows time for orientation, equipment checks, and referee briefing.  
- **Recruitment:** If short-handed, replacements must be secured before the referee meeting. Pulling volunteers out of the stands at kickoff should be a last resort.

## Equipment Check  

- **Down Box:** Cycle through downs 1–4 to confirm smooth operation. For LED boxes, ensure batteries are charged and a manual backup is available.  
- **Sticks & Chain:** Verify the chain measures exactly 10 yards. Inspect links, padding, and visibility markings.  
- **Clip(s):** Confirm at least one reliable clip is available. Professional crews carry two or three. Homemade clips are often sturdier than referee-issued ones.

## Referee Briefing  

- **Timing:** Occurs shortly before kickoff, led by the head linesman.  
- **Purpose:** To align expectations between the officiating crew and the chain gang.  
- **Topics Covered:**  
  - Positioning of the chain crew (decided by coin toss results).  
  - Safety reminders (stay alert, move when players approach).  
  - Procedures for quarter swaps, measurements, and penalties.  
  - Communication standard: always take direction from the referees, not coaches, players, or fans.

## Pregame Responsibilities by Role  

- **Box Operator:** Pays close attention to the coin toss to identify the sideline where the crew will set up. Prepares to position the down marker immediately.  
- **Stick Crew:** Double-checks chain integrity, then stands ready to mark the line of scrimmage and line to gain.  
- **Clip Operator:** Places the clip on the designated yard line once the initial ball spot is confirmed. Ensures visibility and announces placement (e.g., “Clip on the 45”).

## Special Case: Away Games  

While most chain gang duties occur at home games, experienced crew members sometimes attend away games as spectators. If the visiting chain gang notices that the home team’s crew is understaffed or struggling, it can be helpful — with permission from the referees and athletic director — to offer assistance.  
This support keeps the game running smoothly and reflects well on both schools. Away-game volunteering should be seen as a professional courtesy, not as an obligation, and should always respect the home school’s authority.

## Professional Standard  

An organized pregame routine sets the tone for the night. Referees quickly recognize when a crew is prepared and attentive — and when it is not. Experienced chain gangs run their pregame like clockwork, building credibility and making the officiating crew’s job easier.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — When the Coin Toss Chose Our Fate  

At one game, the crew assumed they’d be stationed on the home sideline as usual. Then the visiting team won the toss, chose the opposite side, and the referee waved the crew across. They had to scramble, dragging the chain and box through cheerleaders, water bottles, and startled coaches. Since then, the crew’s motto has been: *“Don’t unpack until the coin hits the ground.”*

The habits you set before kickoff ripple through every play; a disciplined pregame routine is the first step toward a disciplined game.
