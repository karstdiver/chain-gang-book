# Chapter 3 — Chain Gang Equipment

The tools of the chain gang are simple but indispensable. Without them, the 
game cannot be played in any recognizable form. A well-prepared crew not only 
understands how to operate the equipment but also how to check, maintain, and 
protect it.  

There are three primary tools used by every high school chain gang: the down 
box, the sticks, and the clip. Each has unique responsibilities and quirks 
that must be respected.

## The Down Box (Down Marker)

**Purpose:** Displays the current down (1st through 4th) and physically marks 
the line of scrimmage.  

**Operation:**  
- Position it exactly where the head linesman indicates, typically at the 
  linesman’s right foot.  
- Flip the indicator quickly and confidently after each play.  
- For special plays (extra points, field goals), rotate the box sideways to 
  hide the number, leaving only the upright pole visible.  

**Modern Variations:**  
- Many schools use LED boxes for visibility. These must be charged postgame.  
- A manual backup is advisable in case of battery failure.

## The Sticks (First Down Markers & Chain)

**Purpose:** Establishes the 10-yard distance between the line of scrimmage 
and the line-to-gain for a first down.  

**Operation:**  
- Always maintain a tight 10-yard distance.  
- Use clear communication signals (thumbs-up before pulling the chain taut).  
- Be ready to sprint onto the field for measurements when directed.  

**Care & Storage:**  
- After the game, wrap the chain securely around the base of the sticks.  
- Store in a safe location, away from kinks or tangles.  

**Visibility:**  
- Bright orange banners or padding should be secured and in good condition.  
- Faded or missing covers reduce visibility for players and officials.

## The Clip

**Purpose:** Provides precision anchoring to a specific yard line, allowing 
accurate resets, quarter changes, and measurements.  

**Operation:**  
- Place on the inside edge of the closest yard line to the ball.  
- Announce loudly (“Clip on 45!”) for referee confirmation.  
- Assist referees during quarter swaps and measurements.  

**Advanced Systems:**  
- *One-clip system:* Standard but vulnerable to mistakes.  
- *Two-clip system:* Professional crews often use this to ensure accuracy if 
  chains are moved inadvertently.  
- *Three-clip system:* Rare but useful for crews wanting redundancy.  

**Maintenance:**  
- Carry spare clips. Homemade or custom versions can be sturdier than 
  referee-issued ones.  
- A basic chain repair kit (slip rings, spring clips) should always be part of 
  the clip operator’s kit.

## Inspection & Maintenance Protocol

Every crew should inspect the equipment before kickoff:  

- **Box:** Flip through all down positions (1–4) to ensure smooth operation.  
- **Sticks:** Check chain for kinks, frays, or weak links. Verify 10-yard 
  distance.  
- **Clip:** Ensure it attaches securely, markings are visible, and at least one 
  backup is available.  

A game flows best when the chain gang eliminates surprises before they occur.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — The Day the Chain Snapped at 3rd and 1

During one game, just as the offense lined up on a critical 3rd-and-1, the 
chain split in half. For a moment, chaos. Players looked around. Coaches 
yelled. The referee muttered words not fit for print. Luckily, the head 
linesman had a slip ring in his pocket. With a quick repair, the game was back 
in action in under two minutes. Since then, the crew’s motto has been: “Carry 
a chain repair kit — or be the reason halftime comes early.”
