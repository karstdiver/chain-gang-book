# Chapter 12 — Weather Conditions & Special Circumstances

Weather is one of the few factors no crew can control, yet it shapes nearly every
game. From blazing heat to lightning delays, chain gangs must be prepared to
adapt quickly and professionally. A crew that is weather-ready keeps the game
moving safely while showing referees and athletic directors that they can be
trusted in all conditions.

## Heat Management

- Wear lightweight, breathable clothing in school colors or neutral tones.
- Use cooling towels or helmet liners during hot weather.
- Long-sleeve, hooded shirts can protect skin from direct sunlight and actually
  keep body temperature down when chosen in light, breathable fabrics.
- Carry water and take small sips during breaks in play.

---

## Cold Weather

- Layer clothing: base layer for warmth, mid-layer for insulation, outer shell
  for wind protection.
- Modern heated clothing (vests, socks, gloves) powered by USB packs can extend
  comfort in long, cold games.
- Stay mobile between plays to prevent stiffness.

---

## Rain & Storms

- Lightweight ponchos or frog togs that can be stowed in a bag or clipped to a
  belt are essential.
- Keep a plastic bag for valuables such as phone and wallet.
- Avoid umbrellas, which block vision and create hazards on the sideline.

---

## Lightning Delays

- Lightning within a designated range requires a mandatory delay, usually
  30 minutes from the most recent strike.
- Evacuate immediately to a safe location — do not linger near metal equipment
  or goalposts.
- Crews may not have time to return to vehicles, so know the location of the
  nearest shelter.

## Professional Standard

Weather does not excuse unprofessional conduct. Crews that prepare for extreme
conditions stay safe, keep officials focused on the game, and demonstrate pride
in their role. The chain gang that handles weather calmly and competently is
the crew referees and athletic directors want back every season.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — "No Bad Weather"

During one unexpectedly chilly game, the head linesman asked the crew if they
were cold. They admitted they were. He smiled and said, "There is no such thing
as bad weather, just bad clothing." The crew laughed, but the point was made —
preparation is the key to professionalism.

Weather can be chaotic, but professionalism means the chain gang adapts without missing a step.
