# Chapter 7 — The Sticks (First Down Markers)

The sticks are the backbone of the chain gang. They define the 10-yard 
distance between the line of scrimmage and the line to gain, creating the 
visual standard that drives offensive strategy. While the job may look simple 
— “stay 10 yards apart” — the execution requires focus, communication, and 
teamwork.  

Handled poorly, the sticks can slow the game or compromise fairness. Handled 
well, they become invisible — the highest compliment a chain crew can receive.

## Primary Responsibilities

### Mark the Line of Scrimmage and Line to Gain  
- One stick stays aligned with the down marker at the line of scrimmage.  
- The other marks the line 10 yards ahead.  

### Maintain Proper Distance  
- Keep the chain between them taut and accurate.  
- Maintain constant vigilance to prevent slack, kinks, or accidental 
  misplacement.  

### Respond to Signals  
- Set the near stick first, then signal with a thumbs-up when secure.  
- Pull the chain taut and lock position as the downfield stick operator.  

### Measurements  
When a close call occurs, the sticks become the centerpiece of the game:  
- Lift both poles while keeping the chain taut upon the referee's signal.  
- Jog onto the field and lay the sticks down for measurement.  
- Ensure accuracy by confirming the clip placement as the clip operator.  

This is a moment of high visibility. A calm, precise response reassures 
referees and spectators alike.

## Storage and Transport

- Align the poles, wrap the chain around the bases, and secure them in a 
  designated storage area after the game.  
- Avoid leaving chains tangled or bent, as they create problems for the next 
  crew and risk safety issues.

## Safety Considerations

Stick operators stand closest to the action. Plays that sweep to the sideline 
often target their zone. Operators must:  
- Stay alert at all times.  
- Be ready to drop the sticks and move quickly if players charge the sideline.  
- Never use the sticks as barriers against incoming players.

## Professional Standard

A disciplined stick crew works like a well-oiled hinge: steady, synchronized, 
and nearly invisible. While the box may be the most visible role and the clip 
the most technical, the sticks form the framework that holds the entire system 
together.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — The Night the Chain Crew Outran the Players

One game, a running back broke free down the sideline — straight toward the 
crew. The near-stick operator dropped his pole and sprinted downfield faster 
than anyone expected. The downfield operator, chain in hand, bolted in the 
opposite direction. The crowd roared, not for the touchdown, but for the 
comedy of two volunteers dragging 10 yards of chain like a runaway kite. From 
that night forward, the referees reminded the crew: “The sticks move faster 
without you attached.”

When the sticks operate smoothly, the game flows; when they falter, everyone notices. Precision here is what keeps the field honest.
