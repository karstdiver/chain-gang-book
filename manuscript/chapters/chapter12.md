# Chapter 12 — Special Weather Conditions

Football is an outdoor game, and the chain crew shares the same exposure as 
players, referees, and fans. Heat, cold, rain, and lightning delays all add 
complexity to the job. A prepared crew adapts smoothly, while an unprepared 
crew risks distraction, discomfort, or worse — unsafe conditions.

## Heat Management

Hot games are the most common challenge.  
- **Hydration:** Carry water and sip often.  
- **Cooling Tools:** Helmet liners, cooling towels, and shade breaks help keep 
  body temperature down.  
- **Clothing Choices:** Long sleeves and hoods can actually keep direct sun off 
  the skin, reducing fatigue from radiant heat.  

---

## Cold Weather

Chilly nights require just as much planning.  
- **Layering:** Multiple light layers insulate better than one heavy jacket.  
- **Modern Gear:** Heated vests, socks, and gloves powered by USB packs are 
  increasingly affordable. They can make late-season games far more tolerable.  
- **Mobility First:** Avoid bulky coats that restrict arm or shoulder movement.

## Rain

Rain is less dangerous than heat or cold but more disruptive to equipment.  
- **Waterproofing:** Lightweight ponchos or frog togs pack down small and keep 
  gear dry.  
- **Electronics:** Keep LED boxes covered if possible. Always carry a plastic 
  bag for your wallet, phone, or radio.  
- **Field Awareness:** Wet sidelines are slippery; shoes with good traction 
  reduce the chance of falls.

## Lightning Delays

Lightning is the one condition that stops football entirely.  
- **The Rule:** Any strike within range adds 30 minutes to the delay.  
- **Safety First:** Volunteers must evacuate the field immediately — often with 
  no time to return to their cars. Identify shelter locations before kickoff.  
- **Patience:** Delays may last an hour or more. Crews should stay together and 
  wait for the all-clear before returning.

## Professional Standard

Weather affects everyone, but a chain crew that prepares for conditions stands 
out. Referees trust a crew that doesn’t need babysitting in the rain. Coaches 
appreciate crews that keep working even in the cold. And athletic directors 
notice when their volunteers show up ready, regardless of forecast.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — “No Such Thing as Bad Weather”

During one unexpectedly chilly game, the head linesman asked the crew if they 
were cold. When they all admitted yes, he replied with a grin: “There is no 
such thing as bad weather — just bad clothing.” The lesson stuck. Since then, 
the crew has invested in better gear, and morale is always higher on frigid 
nights.
