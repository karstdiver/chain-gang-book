# Chapter 5 — Pregame Procedures

A football game begins long before the opening kickoff. For the chain gang, 
professionalism is established during the pregame routine. Proper preparation 
not only builds trust with referees but also prevents embarrassing sideline 
chaos once the ball is in play.

## Crew Coordination

- **Confirm Attendance:** Contact each member of the chain crew earlier in the 
  day. Last-minute absences are common, and substitutes may be needed.  
- **Arrival Time:** Every member should be at the stadium at least 30 minutes 
  before kickoff. This allows time for orientation, equipment checks, and 
  referee briefing.  
- **Recruitment:** If short-handed, replacements must be secured before the 
  referee meeting. Pulling volunteers out of the stands at kickoff should be a 
  last resort.

## Equipment Check

- **Down Box:** Cycle through downs 1–4 to confirm smooth operation. For LED 
  boxes, ensure batteries are charged and a manual backup is available.  
- **Sticks & Chain:** Verify the chain measures exactly 10 yards. Inspect 
  links, padding, and visibility markings.  
- **Clip(s):** Confirm at least one reliable clip is available. Professional 
  crews carry two or three. Homemade clips are often sturdier than 
  referee-issued ones.

## Referee Briefing

- **Timing:** Occurs shortly before kickoff, led by the head linesman.  
- **Purpose:** To align expectations between the officiating crew and the 
  chain gang.  

**Topics Covered:**  
- Positioning of the chain crew (decided by coin toss results).  
- Safety reminders (stay alert, move when players approach).  
- Procedures for quarter swaps, measurements, and penalties.  
- Communication Standard: Always take direction from the referees, not 
  coaches, players, or fans.

## Pregame Responsibilities by Role

- **Box Operator:** Pays close attention to the coin toss to identify the 
  sideline where the crew will set up. Prepares to position the down marker 
  immediately.  
- **Stick Crew:** Double-checks chain integrity, then stands ready to mark the 
  line of scrimmage and line to gain.  
- **Clip Operator:** Places the clip on the designated yard line once the 
  initial ball spot is confirmed. Ensures visibility and announces placement 
  (e.g., “Clip on the 45”).

## The Professional Standard

An organized pregame routine sets the tone for the night. Referees quickly 
recognize when a crew is prepared and attentive — and when it is not. 
Experienced chain gangs run their pregame like clockwork, building credibility 
and making the officiating crew’s job easier.

## Sticks Procedure During Active Play

During plays where the chain gang sticks are not needed, they should be moved horizontally towards the 20-yard line. The sticks and chain should be moved to between the 20-yard line and the goal line. This gets them out of the way on the sideline.

You can either lay them on the ground or hold them vertically or horizontally. The main goal is to clear the sidelines of the sticks to avoid confusion about the location of the first down.

**Pro Tip:** This procedure prevents sideline clutter and ensures that when the sticks are needed again, they're easily accessible without interfering with ongoing play or creating confusion for players, coaches, and officials.

## Box Duty During Quarter Swap

Chain gang box duty involves monitoring the yard mark during the quarter swap. It's crucial because the box operates independently from the sticks and chain.

The box must remember the mark's position on the field, particularly if the head linesman fails to record it. This independent operation requires the box operator to maintain situational awareness throughout the quarter change process.

**Pro Tip:** The box operator serves as a backup reference point for field position when other crew members or officials might lose track of the exact yard line during the quarter swap procedure.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — When the Coin Toss Chose Our Fate

At one game, the crew assumed they'd be stationed on the home sideline as 
usual. Then the visiting team won the toss, chose the opposite side, and the 
referee waved the crew across. They had to scramble, dragging the chain and 
box through cheerleaders, water bottles, and startled coaches. Since then, the 
crew has had a motto: "Don't unpack until the coin hits the ground."
