# Appendix A â€” Chain Gang Crew Configurations

High school football programs vary widely in the resources they provide for 
chain crews. Some schools operate with the full four-person crew, while others 
make do with three. A professional crew should understand the differences and 
be prepared to adapt.

## Four-Person Crew (Preferred)

- **Box Operator (Down Marker):** Marks the line of scrimmage and displays the down.  
- **Two Stick Operators (First Down Markers):** Maintain the 10-yard chain.  
- **Clip Operator:** Anchors accuracy, assists with resets, and supports measurements.  

*Advantages:* Highest precision, faster resets, and clear distribution of 
responsibilities. This is the standard recommended by state officiating 
associations.

## Three-Person Crew (Common at Smaller Schools)

- **Box Operator (Down Marker):** Same responsibilities as in a four-person crew.  
- **Two Stick Operators:** Handle both the chain and clip responsibilities.  

*Challenges:* Less redundancy, clip duties can be overlooked, higher workload 
per person.

## Emergency Configurations

In rare cases (e.g., illness, no-shows, or last-minute substitutions), crews 
may need to improvise:  

- **Two-Person Crew:** One runs the box, one manages both sticks. Extremely 
  challenging and not recommended.  
- **Volunteer Fill-ins:** Coaches, parents, or even fans may be asked to 
  substitute. Brief them quickly: safety first, neutrality second, precision 
  third.

## Professional Standard

Regardless of size, every crew must commit to accuracy, neutrality, and 
professionalism. A well-trained three-person crew is far more effective than a 
disorganized four-person crew. The key is preparation and communication.
