# Chapter 10 — Safety & Liability Framework

Football is a contact sport, and the chain gang stands just a few feet from the 
action. While the job looks simple, it carries real risks. Beyond personal 
safety, the crew also carries a measure of liability for the school. A 
well-trained crew protects not only themselves but also the program’s 
reputation and legal standing.

## Personal Safety on the Sideline

- **Stay Alert:** Always keep one eye on the ball and one on the players. Plays 
  develop quickly, and the sideline is rarely a safe zone.  
- **Drop and Move:** If players charge toward you, drop the sticks or box and 
  get out of the way. Equipment can be replaced; people cannot.  
- **Position Wisely:** Stand slightly back from the sideline when possible. 
  Avoid leaning into the field of play.  
- **Protective Footwear:** Closed-toe athletic shoes are non-negotiable.

## Crew Conduct and Neutrality

- **No Cheering:** The chain gang must remain silent and impartial.  
- **No Coaching:** Volunteers sometimes know players personally, but sideline 
  conversations must be avoided during play.  
- **Professional Demeanor:** The crew represents the school and assists 
  officials, not as fans.

## School Liability Considerations

Athletic directors should treat the chain gang as an extension of event staff. 
That means:  

- **Training:** Provide a short orientation before the season and refreshers as 
  needed.  
- **Uniformity:** Outfit the crew in visible, consistent gear for easy 
  identification.  
- **Coverage:** Ensure volunteers are covered under the school’s liability 
  policies.  
- **Equipment Checks:** Maintain functional, safe equipment to avoid preventable 
  accidents.  

---

## Emergency Preparedness

- **First Aid:** Know the location of medical staff or trainers on the 
  sideline.  
- **Severe Weather:** Be prepared to leave equipment and evacuate during 
  lightning delays.  
- **Backups:** Always have a spare clip, chain repair kit, and, if possible, a 
  manual backup box.

## Professional Standard

The safest chain gang is the most professional chain gang. Alertness, 
neutrality, and preparation reduce risks for everyone involved. Referees notice 
it. Coaches appreciate it. And athletic directors can rest easier knowing their 
volunteers are equipped and trained to handle the unexpected.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — A Grim Request

Before one game, an athletic director came over to the crew and, jokingly, 
requested they each sign a “Do Not Resuscitate” form so that they wouldn’t 
interrupt the flow of the game should anything happen. The point was clear — 
safety is always personal, but professionalism means being prepared.
