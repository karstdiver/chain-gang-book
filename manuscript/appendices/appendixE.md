# Appendix E — Pregame Briefing Template

The pregame briefing is where referees and the chain crew synchronize 
expectations. A professional crew treats this as a structured checklist, not a 
casual conversation.  

---

## Purpose

- Align responsibilities between the officiating crew and chain gang.  
- Clarify procedures for chain movement, resets, and measurements.  
- Emphasize safety and neutrality.  

---

## Template Script

**Head Linesman (HL):**  
- Identifies sideline for the chain gang (based on coin toss).  
- Reviews chain movement signals and commands.  
- Confirms clip procedures (placement, resets, quarter changes).  
- Gives safety reminders: stay alert, drop equipment if players approach.  

**Chain Gang Response:**  
- Box Operator confirms down marker is functional.  
- Stick Crew confirms 10-yard chain measurement.  
- Clip Operator announces readiness and procedure (e.g., “Clip on inside edge 
nearest ball, confirm with HL”).  

---

## Quick Tips for Crews

- Use clear, simple verbal confirmations (“Second on the box,” “Clip on 45”).  
- Establish eye contact with the HL — they are your supervisor.  
- Avoid side conversations; referees appreciate full attention.

## Professional Standard

Crews that run the pregame briefing like clockwork earn instant credibility. 
Referees know they won’t have to babysit, and athletic directors see a crew 
that takes its responsibilities seriously.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — The Reputation Joke

Early in one season, a linesman jogged over to the crew before the briefing. 
He looked them over and said, “You guys have a reputation as the second-best 
chain gang in the state.” After a pause to let them celebrate, he added, “And 
that’s only because everyone else is tied for first.” The crew laughed — and 
the joke became their unofficial motto.
