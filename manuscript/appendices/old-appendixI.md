# Appendix I — Special Weather Circumstances

Football is played in every kind of weather, and the chain gang must be just as 
prepared as the athletes and referees. Heat, cold, rain, and lightning all 
present unique challenges.

## Heat

- **Hydration:** Bring water, take sips often.  
- **Cooling Tools:** Cooling towels, helmet liners, and shade breaks reduce 
  strain.  
- **Clothing Choices:** Long sleeves and hoods can protect skin from direct sun 
  and prevent overheating.  

---

## Cold

- **Layering:** Multiple light layers provide flexibility and warmth.  
- **Modern Gear:** Heated vests, socks, and gloves powered by USB packs are 
  affordable and effective.  
- **Stay Mobile:** Bulky coats restrict agility; prioritize freedom of movement.  

---

## Rain

- **Waterproofing:** Carry lightweight ponchos or frog togs.  
- **Protect Electronics:** Use plastic bags for LED boxes, phones, or radios.  
- **Footing:** Wet sidelines are slippery — good traction is essential.  

---

## Lightning

- **The Rule:** Any visible lightning strike within range results in a 30-minute 
  delay, with each new strike resetting the clock.  
- **Evacuation:** Volunteers must leave the field immediately, often without 
  time to return to cars. Identify shelters beforehand.  
- **Extended Delays:** Be prepared to sit and wait — patience is part of the job.

## Professional Standard

Weather should never surprise a professional crew. Prepared volunteers protect 
themselves, reassure referees, and uphold the flow of the game when play 
resumes. Athletic directors especially value crews who come ready for anything.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — “No Such Thing as Bad Weather”

During one unexpectedly cold game, the head linesman asked the crew if they 
were chilly. When they admitted yes, he smiled and replied: “There is no such 
thing as bad weather — just bad clothing.” Since then, the crew has upgraded 
gear and stayed comfortable through every forecast.
