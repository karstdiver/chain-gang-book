# Appendix F — Placeholder Images & Diagrams

Illustrations bring clarity to chain crew operations. While photos and diagrams 
may be added later, this appendix marks where they belong and what they should 
convey.

## Suggested Images

1. **Full Crew Setup:** A sideline view showing box, sticks, and clip operator.  
2. **Down Marker:** Close-up of both mechanical and LED versions.

4. **Clip Placement:** Demonstration of positioning on the inside edge of a 
yard line.  
5. **Measurement Procedure:** Referees and crew bringing chains onto the field.  
6. **Pregame Briefing:** Crew meeting with head linesman.  
7. **Weather Gear:** Example of layered cold-weather clothing and rain gear.  
8. **Safety Incidents:** Diagram of “drop and move” response to sideline 
collisions.

## Style Guidelines

- **Captions:** Every image should have a simple numbered caption (e.g., 
  *Figure 3: Clip placement on yard line*).  
- **Consistency:** Use the same fonts, colors, and visual style for diagrams.  
- **Placement:** Insert images at the end of sections or chapters, not in the 
  middle of paragraphs.

## Professional Standard

Images should educate, not decorate. A referee flipping through this manual 
should be able to glance at a figure and instantly understand the point.
