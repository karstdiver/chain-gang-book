# Appendix H — Physical Considerations

Serving on a chain crew may not look athletic, but it demands stamina, agility, 
and awareness. Treating the role like light exercise improves performance and 
reduces injury risk.

## Fitness Factors by Role

- **Box Operator:** Requires bursts of speed, especially after long plays that 
end in touchdowns. Sprinting to reset for extra points is part of the job.  
- **Stick Crew:** Jogging and quick movements with the chain occur throughout 
the game. Staying balanced while players barrel down the sideline is critical.  
- **Clip Operator:** Frequent bending, squatting, and hustling to align the 
clip add up over four quarters.

## Stretching & Warm-Up

- Focus on hamstrings, calves, and back before the game.  
- Light sideline stretches during pregame briefing prepare muscles for the 
unexpected sprint.  

---

## Hydration & Endurance

- Carry a small water bottle or stash one near the box or yard markers.  
- Take quick sips during stoppages. Dehydration leads to fatigue and mistakes.  
- Pacing matters: urgency is key, but sprinting everywhere early can lead to 
burnout in the fourth quarter.

## Pro Tip

Yard markers on the sideline (cones or boxes) can serve as stash spots for 
jackets or rain gear. Keep items light and minimal, and never forget them 
during weather delays or evacuation.  

---

## Professional Standard

A fit chain crew is a dependable chain crew. Crews that take their physical 
preparation seriously avoid fatigue, reduce mistakes, and show referees and 
athletic directors that they are capable of handling the game from kickoff to 
the final whistle.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — The Tangle at the 30

During one game, a running back was shoved out of bounds directly into the 
stick crew. One operator instinctively tried to hold the stick steady. Both 
went tumbling, the chain snapped, and the game was delayed. Since then, the 
crew has repeated the lesson: drop the sticks and live to measure another down.
