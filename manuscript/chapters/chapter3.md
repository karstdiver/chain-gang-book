# Chapter 3 — Chain Gang Equipment

The tools of the chain gang are simple but indispensable. Without them, the 
game cannot be played in any recognizable form. A well-prepared crew not only 
understands how to operate the equipment but also how to check, maintain, and 
protect it.  

There are three primary tools used by every high school chain gang: the down 
box, the sticks, and the clip. Each has unique responsibilities and quirks 
that must be respected.

## The Down Box (Down Marker)

**Purpose:** Displays the current down (1st through 4th) and physically marks 
the line of scrimmage.  

**Operation:**  
- Position it exactly where the head linesman indicates, typically at the 
  linesman’s right foot.  
- Flip the indicator quickly and confidently after each play.  
- For special plays (extra points, field goals), rotate the box sideways to 
  hide the number, leaving only the upright pole visible.  

**Modern Variations:**  
- Many schools use LED boxes for visibility. These must be charged postgame.  
- A manual backup is advisable in case of battery failure.

## The Sticks (First Down Markers & Chain)

**Purpose:** Establishes the 10-yard distance between the line of scrimmage 
and the line-to-gain for a first down.  

**Operation:**  
- Always maintain a tight 10-yard distance.  
- Use clear communication signals (thumbs-up before pulling the chain taut).  
- Be ready to sprint onto the field for measurements when directed.  

**Care & Storage:**  
- After the game, wrap the chain securely around the base of the sticks.  
- Store in a safe location, away from kinks or tangles.  

**Visibility:**  
- Bright orange banners or padding should be secured and in good condition.  
- Faded or missing covers reduce visibility for players and officials.

## The Clip

**Purpose:** Provides precision anchoring to a specific yard line, allowing 
accurate resets, quarter changes, and measurements.  

**Operation:**  
- Place on the inside edge of the closest yard line to the ball.  
- Announce loudly (“Clip on 45!”) for referee confirmation.  
- Assist referees during quarter swaps and measurements.  

**Advanced Systems:**  
- *One-clip system:* Standard but vulnerable to mistakes.  
- *Two-clip system:* Professional crews often use this to ensure accuracy if 
  chains are moved inadvertently.  
- *Three-clip system:* Rare but useful for crews wanting redundancy.  

**Maintenance:**  
- Carry spare clips. Homemade or custom versions can be sturdier than 
  referee-issued ones.  
- A basic chain repair kit (slip rings, spring clips) should always be part of 
  the clip operator’s kit.

## The Clip: Physical Design and Customization

The clip has two primary functions that determine its effectiveness. First, it must attach securely to a single chain link. Second, it must clearly indicate the yard marker where it's positioned. The effectiveness of these functions depends on the clip's design and any customizations made by the chain gang.

**Standard Clips**

You can purchase pre-made clips from online stores like Horning. These are affordable and typically come with a spring clip attached to either a strip clip or a dial clip. However, the standard spring clip is quite small, making it difficult to pinch and attach to the chain efficiently and comfortably.

**Pro Tip:** If the clip operator is uncomfortable due to something as simple as sore fingers from using a small clip, the chain gang isn't performing as well as it could. For someone new to using these clips, this discomfort can quickly become a problem.

**Customization Solutions**

To address this issue, I've added larger spring clips to my clips. These are easier on my thumb and fingers, making it more comfortable to attach and detach them. Remember, if you're using a two-clip system, you'll be doing this at least twice every series.

**Clip Indicators**

There are two types of indicators on these clips:

- **Cloth Strip Clip:** Features a cloth strip with yard numbers either embroidered or printed along it. A plastic clip slides up and down this strip to mark the yard marker.

- **Circular Dial Clip:** Features a circular clip with a dial that has a window displaying the yard marker line.

**Pro Tip:** I've found that the circular clip is physically harder to use than the cloth strip clip. This is an important consideration for new users and something the head linesman should consider when providing clips to the team.

**Durability Concerns**

The circular clip seems prone to breakage. It's made of plastic and has a single attachment point. A strong impact, like a cleat step, could easily break it. Therefore, it's advisable to have a backup clip in the kit.

**Pro Tip:** Carry the clips on a lanyard. Imagine having a lanyard around your neck with a slip ring at the end. You can use the spring clip to easily attach it to the slip ring. This setup helps you quickly locate and handle the clips.

## Inspection & Maintenance Protocol

Every crew should inspect the equipment before kickoff:  

- **Box:** Flip through all down positions (1–4) to ensure smooth operation.  
- **Sticks:** Check chain for kinks, frays, or weak links. Verify 10-yard 
  distance.  
- **Clip:** Ensure it attaches securely, markings are visible, and at least one 
  backup is available.  

A game flows best when the chain gang eliminates surprises before they occur.

## Chain Gang Kits: Organization and Preparation

There are two main types of kits for the chain gang, specifically for the clip operator. Understanding both helps you stay organized and prepared for any situation.

**The Game Day Kit**

The game day kit includes everything you need to perform your role on the field. It contains all the necessary and sufficient items for game day operations. The contents of this kit are often influenced by the weather, your uniform, and the specific role you will be playing.

**Pro Tip:** Always carry ChapStick in your game day kit. It's small, fits easily in a pocket, and is indispensable when you need it. Chapped lips can be a real distraction, often caused by wind or varying humidity levels. So, always carry two ChapSticks.

**The Non-Game Day Kit**

The non-game day kit is the primary storage system that holds all your chain gang gear, including personal game day items and instruments. For instance, I use a heavy-duty plastic bag to store all my gear. I simply grab it by the handles, stash it in the car, and take items out as needed on game day. After the game, everything goes back into the plastic bag.

This bag also hangs neatly on a hanger in the closet alongside your chain gang uniforms or shirts. Essentially, the game day kit is a subset of the non-game day kit.

**Pro Tip:** Think of your non-game day kit as a go bag or grab bag that contains everything you might need for the field.

**Backup Strategy**

**Pro Tip:** Consider buying backups of some items in your kit. I make sure to have multiple ChapSticks and also prefer to have two helmet liners in my grab bag. These items are crucial for performing well on the sideline, and it's important to have them readily available.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — The Day the Chain Snapped at 3rd and 1

During one game, just as the offense lined up on a critical 3rd-and-1, the 
chain split in half. For a moment, chaos. Players looked around. Coaches 
yelled. The referee muttered words not fit for print. Luckily, the head 
linesman had a slip ring in his pocket. With a quick repair, the game was back 
in action in under two minutes. Since then, the crew’s motto has been: “Carry 
a chain repair kit — or be the reason halftime comes early.”
