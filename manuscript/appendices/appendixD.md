# Appendix D — Uniform Reference & Standards

Chain gang crews don’t need pads or whistles, but they are part of the 
officiating environment. Uniform standards project professionalism, improve 
safety, and make the crew easy to identify on the sideline.  

---

## Headwear

- **Preferred:** Matching hats in school colors or referee-style black caps.  
- **Why it matters:** Sun protection and immediate identification.  

---

## Shirts

- **Preferred:** Matching polos or T-shirts with school logo and “Chain Gang” 
  clearly displayed.  
- **Fabric:** Breathable, durable material is best for long games.  

---

## Bottoms

- **Options:**  
  - Warm weather: khaki shorts.  
  - Cool weather: referee pants or dark-colored slacks.  
- **Key Point:** Comfort and flexibility for running, squatting, and 
  sideline agility.  

---

## Footwear

- **Requirement:** Closed-toe athletic shoes, preferably black to match 
  officials.  
- **Avoid:** Sandals, cleats, or casual slip-ons.  
- **Why it matters:** Prevents injuries during collisions or long games.  

---

## Socks

- **No strict rules:** But black or neutral colors project neatness.  

---

## Weather Gear

- **Rain:** Ponchos, frog togs, or lightweight waterproof jackets.  
- **Cold:** Layered clothing that allows freedom of movement.  
- **Modern Additions:** Heated vests, socks, and gloves powered by USB packs.

## Professional Standard

Consistency in appearance signals professionalism. Athletic directors notice 
crews that dress alike, referees respect the effort, and players see the crew 
as part of the officiating team — not just fans with field access.
