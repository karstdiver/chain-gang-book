# Chapter 9 — Working with Referees

The chain gang may be volunteers, but once the game begins, they are part of 
the officiating crew. This relationship is built on trust, communication, and 
discipline. Referees rely on the chain gang to mark the field accurately, 
respond to signals promptly, and maintain professionalism under pressure.  

The best chain crews view themselves as extensions of the officiating team. 
This mindset reduces confusion, speeds up the game, and ensures fairness for 
both sides.

## Roles of the Referee and Head Linesman

### Referee (White Hat)  
The leader of the officiating crew. While the referee may glance at the chains 
occasionally, their main concern is game management and enforcement of rules.  

### Head Linesman (HL)  
The official assigned to the chain gang’s sideline. They are the direct 
supervisor. The HL communicates spots, downs, penalties, and movements. In 
practice, the chain gang reports to the HL at all times.

## Pregame Expectations

The HL typically conducts a short meeting with the crew before kickoff.  

**Key topics:**  
- Where the crew will be stationed (determined by coin toss).  
- Signals for moving or holding the chains.  
- Clip placement and chain reset procedures.  
- Safety reminders (stay alert, drop the equipment if necessary).  

This is also the moment when referees inspect the equipment: confirming the 
chain measures exactly 10 yards and the down box functions correctly.

## Game-Time Communication

- **Signals to Move:** Never move the chains until the HL signals. Even if the 
  play looks like a first down, wait for confirmation.  
- **Flags on the Field:** If any crew member sees a penalty flag, they should 
  point to it. This alerts others not to move until the play is resolved.  
- **Verbal Confirmation:** Box operators should announce the down, and clip 
  operators should call out placement clearly. Referees appreciate the 
  redundancy.

## Professional Neutrality

The chain gang must remain neutral at all times. That means:  
- No cheering, coaching, or sideline commentary.  
- No conversations with players or coaches outside of chain operations.  
- No visible favoritism toward the home team, even if recruited by the school.  

Neutrality builds credibility. Referees trust crews that stay silent, sharp, 
and impartial.

## Repair and Emergency Preparedness

Referees often carry small chain repair tools, but the crew should not rely 
solely on them. A clip operator or HL should have a slip ring or spring clip 
available in case of a broken chain. A two-minute repair feels like an 
eternity in-game — preparedness avoids disruption.  

---

## Professional Standard

Working well with referees is about earning trust. A disciplined chain gang 
that listens, communicates, and stays neutral quickly becomes a crew that 
officials request by name. Athletic directors notice too — a professional crew 
is a point of pride for any program.

### SIDEBAR: From the Sideline — The Linesman’s Poker Face

One HL was known for never cracking a smile. For three quarters, it seemed he 
was unhappy with the crew’s work. Then, late in the game, a coach screamed 
about the spot of the ball. The HL pointed calmly to the clip, nodded once, 
and said, “Crew’s right.” That was the only compliment the crew got all night 
— but it meant more than a dozen high-fives.
